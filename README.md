# TESSA
**Te**nsor-based **SSA** for sparse datasets with spatiotemporal information.

This package is designed to perform multivariate timeseries analysis based on the generalization of the SSA method to sparse higher order (3D) data.

See an example on the analysis of spatiotemporal humidity data in the [Example-1.ipynb](Example-1.ipynb) jupyter notebook.
